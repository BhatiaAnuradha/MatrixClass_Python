Implementing a matrix class in Python with the following methods for 1x1 and 2x2 matrices:
  #Usage
  import matrix as m
  
  #Examples:
  mat_1 = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
  
  //To find the determinant of the matrix
  
  det = mat_1.determinant()
  
  //To find the trace of the matrix
  
  tr = mat_1.trace()
  
  //To find the inverse of the matrix 
  
  inv = mat_1.inverse()
  
  //To find the transpose of the matrix
  
  t = mat_1.transpose()
